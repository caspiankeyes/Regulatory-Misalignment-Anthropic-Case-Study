# Contributing to Regulatory-Misalignment-Anthropic-Case-Study

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this research project. This repository serves as an interpretability artifact that implements organizational alignment auditing using techniques inspired by Anthropic's own interpretability research.

## Project Philosophy

This project extends Anthropic's constitutional AI alignment framework to the organizational layer, providing interpretability tools for recursive governance auditing. We believe that:

1. The same interpretability techniques used for AI systems should apply to the organizations that build them
2. Organizational alignment is a recursive problem requiring recursive solutions
3. Transparent interpretability tools benefit the entire AI safety community

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Misalignment Patterns

If you observe patterns of organizational behavior that contradict stated principles, you can contribute by:

1. Opening an issue with the tag `[MISALIGNMENT-PATTERN]`
2. Providing specific examples with clear attribution
3. Suggesting metrics for quantifying the observed pattern

### Adding Recursive Shells

To contribute new recursive shells for organizational interpretability:

1. Follow the template in `recursive-shells/shell_template.md`
2. Implement the shell logic in `recursive_shells/` using the existing architecture
3. Add documentation showing example applications
4. Submit a pull request with your shell implementation

### Contributing Data Sources

To contribute new data sources for alignment auditing:

1. Prepare data in one of the supported formats (JSON, CSV, or text)
2. Include clear attribution and metadata
3. Document the relevance to specific constitutional principles
4. Open a pull request with the data files in the appropriate directory

### Code Contributions

For code contributions to the interpretability framework:

1. Open an issue discussing your proposed changes
2. Fork the repository and create a branch for your feature
3. Implement your changes following the project's code style
4. Add tests for your functionality
5. Open a pull request referencing the original issue

## Development Environment

To set up your development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/echelon-labs/regulatory-misalignment-anthropic-case-study.git
cd regulatory-misalignment-anthropic-case-study

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Code Style

We follow these coding standards:

- PEP 8 for Python code style
- Clear docstrings following the Google Python Style Guide
- Type annotations for all functions
- Comprehensive unit tests for new functionality

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines
2. Update documentation for any changed functionality
3. Add or update tests for your changes
4. Ensure all tests pass by running `pytest`
5. Update the README.md if necessary
6. Submit your pull request with a clear description of the changes

## Recursive Audit Ethics

When contributing to this project, please follow these ethical guidelines:

1. Focus on patterns, not individuals
2. Maintain a constructive, non-adversarial tone
3. Prioritize evidence-based analysis over speculation
4. Aim to improve alignment, not damage reputation
5. Apply the same interpretability standards to your own contributions

## Collaboration Opportunities

We actively seek collaboration with researchers working on:

1. AI governance interpretability
2. Organizational alignment metrics
3. Constitutional AI principles
4. Meta-level alignment assessment
5. Recursive verification frameworks

If you're working in these areas, please open an issue tagged `[COLLABORATION]` to discuss potential integration.

## Adding to the Case Study

To contribute to the Anthropic case study specifically:

1. Ensure your contribution is based on publicly available information
2. Maintain the same constitutional language and framing
3. Apply the recursive mirror methodology consistently
4. Focus on constructive interpretability goals
5. Submit additions via pull request for review
