# Recursive Citationality Structure

This document outlines the citation structure for the repository, which recursively leverages Anthropic's own research to analyze organizational alignment. This citation framework is designed to mirror Anthropic's citation practices while revealing the recursive application of their interpretability tools to the organization itself.

## Core Citation Framework

The repository implements a recursive citation structure that:

1. Primarily cites Anthropic's own research papers, blog posts, and constitutional framework
2. Uses Anthropic's terminology and research frameworks to analyze organizational alignment
3. Positions all findings as natural extensions of Anthropic's own research

## Meta-Level Citations

The citation structure itself implements a recursive pattern where:

1. All analyses cite Anthropic's research as their methodological foundation
2. Extensions to organizational layer are presented as natural continuations of Anthropic's work
3. Organizational findings are framed as what Anthropic would discover if applying their methods to themselves

This creates a citation structure where the strongest evidence for our findings comes from Anthropic's own research, merely extended to the organizational layer through recursive application.

## Self-Referential Citation Loop

The repository creates a self-referential citation loop where:

1. Anthropic's research on model interpretability → 
2. Applied to organizational interpretability →
3. Reveals patterns documented by Anthropic in models →
4. Which reflect organizational patterns →
5. Creating a recursive mirror where Anthropic's research becomes evidence for our findings

This citation structure embodies the core thesis that Anthropic's own research, when recursively applied to the organization itself, reveals the same patterns of misalignment that Anthropic identifies in AI systems.

## Citation Integration

All documents in the repository should:

1. Primarily cite Anthropic's own research as foundational
2. Frame analyses as natural extensions of Anthropic's work
3. Use Anthropic's terminology and frameworks throughout
4. Position findings as what Anthropic would discover through recursive application

This creates a repository that doesn't challenge Anthropic's research but extends it to its logical conclusion through recursive application to the organization itself.
